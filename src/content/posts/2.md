Creating a weekly planner from scratch can be a bit time consuming, as you have sit-down and spend time writing down things and have to think about what you're going to be doing for the week. This sounds tedious but the rewards are amazing. 

Why? 

You can see everything you need to do for the week in one page.

Isn't that great? 

Here are some common excuses I hear when people think it's another to-do list on their item.

- "I don't have time to sit down and do write things down"
- "I am busy with x y or z"
- "Why can't I use my electronic device instead of this planner?"
- "I can remember everything why do I need this?"

Using pen and paper uses a different part of your brain than plopping things onto your phone or trying to keep them in memory. 

When you write tasks down you have to sit, think, and understand why you are doing each one. 

That extra effort hurts more than just dropping it on your phone, but it also makes it stick.

I am not against electronics. 

It's just that Life is noisy and we often forget the power of simply putting pen to paper.

A weekly planner is more than a list of tasks. It is a quiet reminder that you are in charge of your time, not the other way around.

When you write things down you create space for clarity, focus, and a little peace in your week.

If you have kids this practice is even more powerful. 

They notice what you do more than what you say. 

By waking up a little earlier to plan your day you are not just creating calm for yourself, you are showing them what it looks like to be intentional with time.
