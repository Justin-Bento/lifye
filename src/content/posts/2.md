Creating a weekly planner from scratch can be a bit time consuming, as you have sit-down and spend time writing down things and have to think about what you're going to be doing for the week. This sounds tedious but the rewards are amazing. 

Why? 

You can see everything you need to do for the week in one page.

Isn't that great? 

Here are some common excuses I hear when people think it's another to-do list on their item.

"I don't have time to sit down and do write things down"
"I am busy with x y or z"
"Why can't I use my electronic device instead of this planner?"
I can remember everything why do I need thisa?
